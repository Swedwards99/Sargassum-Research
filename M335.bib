abstract = {(Table presented.). Summary: Plant biology is experiencing a renewed interest in the mechanistic underpinnings and evolution of phenotypic plasticity that calls for a re-evaluation of how we analyse phenotypic responses to a rapidly changing climate. We suggest that dissecting plant plasticity in response to increasing temperature needs an approach that can represent plasticity over multiple environments, and considers both population-level responses and the variation between genotypes in their response. Here, we outline how a random regression mixed model framework can be applied to plastic traits that show linear or nonlinear responses to temperature. Random regressions provide a powerful and efficient means of characterising plasticity and its variation. Although they have been used widely in other fields, they have only recently been implemented in plant evolutionary ecology. We outline their structure and provide an example tutorial of their implementation.},

abstract = {This study compared seasonal growth, development and reproduction of the invasive brown macroalga Sargassum muticum in habitats with different wave exposure on the Irish west coast. Three field sites with different degrees of wave exposure were chosen for monthly observations to reflect different habitats that were characteristic of the Irish west coast. Growth and receptacle development differed considerably between sites. Growth and receptacle development was lower at the most sheltered site. Here, S. muticum showed signs of early fragmentation in April/May during the two years of investigation (2007 and 2008), whilst the population at an exposed site developed normally and plants grew to a maximum average length of 163 cm by July, with the onset of fragmentation in August. Sargassum muticum in a tide pool exhibited a similar seasonal growth cycle as plants at the exposed open shore site. Overall growth however was stunted, with plants reaching a maximum length of only 30-40 cm in July. Receptacle development was also inhibited at the sheltered site, with a maximum of only 10{\%} of plants found to be fertile during spring and summer 2008, while plants at the exposed site and the tide pool exhibited 100{\%} plant fertility by August. An extensive occurrence of the native epiphyte Pylaiella littoralis on S. muticum was noticed during field sampling at the sheltered study site which may have contributed to inhibited development of S. muticum observed in this area.Seasonal biomass production, photosynthetic activity and plant/frond ratio development were contrasted between Sargassum muticum at the open shore and the tide pool. Sargassum muticum biomass production in the tide pool was 3.5 times lower than that of plants on the open shore. Receptacle development and seasonal photosynthetic activity were similar for tide pool and open shore plants, irrespective of morphological differences. Highest photosynthetic rates (fluorescence yield, Yo) were measured during active growth in February and lowest values during development of reproductive tissue and senescence. Numbers of S. muticum plants on the open shore decreased significantly during the year, whilst frond number per plant increased, possibly suggesting self-thinning through shading processes.The high variability in Sargassum muticum productivity and reproductive development between habitats suggests that the degree of competition and impact on native flora could be site-specific, and their local effect on displacements will require further investigations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduced algae have become a prominent component of the marine flora in many regions worldwide. In the NE Pacific, the introduced Japanese alga Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt is common and abundant in shallow, subtidal, rocky habitats, but its effects on subtidal, benthic communities in this region have not previously been studied. I measured the response of native species to experimental manipulation of S. muticum in field experiments in the San Juan Islands of Washington State. Native canopy (brown) and understory (red) algae were more abundant in plots from which S. muticum had been removed, and the native kelp Laminaria bongardiana (the most abundant species of brown alga in the absence of S. muticum) grew more than twice as fast in plots where S. muticum was absent. The negative effects of S. muticum on native algae appear to be a result of shading, rather than changes in water flow, sedimentation, or nutrient availability. S. muticum also had a strongly negative indirect effect on the native sea urchin Stronglyocentrotus droebachiensis by reducing abundances of the native kelp species on which it prefers to feed. My results indicate that S. muticum has a substantial impact on native communities in this region, including effects at multiple trophic levels. Because of their worldwide distribution and capacity to alter native communities, non-indigenous algae are potentially important agents of global ecological change.},

This review considers one of the best- studied and most widespread invasive macroalgae, Sargassum muticum, to determine the traits and processes important in marine invasions and to identify important lines of future research. Particular emphasis is placed on the ecology of S. muticum in its native range and on the four stages of invasion—transport, colonization, establishment, and spread—integrating taxonomy, invasion his- tory, dispersal, impact, invasiveness and invasibility, and general ecology. Although S. muticum has received a lot of scientific attention, with more than 650 papers on this species, key information on its taxonomy, invasive biology, and evolutionary potential is still lacking. Most previous studies have been local or descriptive or provide circumstantial evidence, and too few have been hypothesis driven. Only by local- scale research conducted in different geographical regions, especially including the native range, and developed in an eco- evolutionary framework, will it be possible to greatly improve our understanding of the complex of factors, traits, and processes involved in macroalgal invasions.},

abstract = {1. Phenotypic plasticity has long been suggested to facilitate biological invasions where a general purpose genotype or 'Jack-of-all-trades' strategy could facilitate invasion should native species be, on average, more specialized. Current understanding of the importance of phenotypic plasticity is limited by methodological difficulties yet glasshouse experiments, paralleling those used in evolutionary biology, are increasingly being used to assess whether invasive species have high phenotypic plasticity or not. Unfortunately, these studies have several major limitations. 2. In general, glasshouse experiments have quantified relatively labile means of expressing phenotypes, such as plant biomass, rather than changes in plant development. As some environments favour plant growth and reproduction more than others, simply quantifying allometric or physiological responses relating to differential plant growth may not reveal much about phenotypic plasticity. 3. Plasticity is often a comparative rather than an absolute measure. A range of comparators have been used, for example, unrelated natives, congeneric natives, other congeneric aliens or conspecifics from the source region. Thus, unlike many life-history traits used in analyses of invasion, phenotypic plasticity is strongly context-dependent and limits comparison across different studies. 4. Phenotypic plasticity is assumed to lead to a greater breadth of environmental conditions across which a species can maintain positive population growth and increase the likelihood of invasiveness. Yet, most studies examine only a partial subset of the full environmental range experienced by the species. If the reaction norm of a target species and its comparator vary independently across an environmental gradient, this partial approach can present different interpretations of phenotypic plasticity. 5. Rather than simply quantifying greater phenotypic plasticity in invasive species, research questions should be directed at better understanding its role in the geographic distribution, successful colonization, population persistence and/or high local abundance of invasive species in the introduced range. These issues require integrated measures of plant performance rather than crude differences in individual traits across an environmental gradient. As yet, there is only limited appreciation of the role of phenotypic plasticity in any one of these areas and there is a need to extend studies beyond glasshouse experiments. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in resource availability are a key factor controlling the susceptibility of an environment to invasion by non-indigenous species. Increases in the availability of resources will facilitate the invasion of habitats and assemblages. In this study, we tested experimentally the combined effects of intensity and temporal variability of nutrient supply on the invasion of a low intertidal macroalgal assemblage along the rocky shore of Galicia (northwest Spain) by the brown seaweed Sargassum muticum (Yendo). We estimated invasibility by measuring the number of plants, length of plants and biomass of S. muticum. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that intensity and temporal variation of nutrient addition would affect interactively the invasion of macroalgal assemblages with high temporal variability emphasizing the effects of a high intensity of nutrient addition. Results indicated interactive effects between intensity and temporal variability of nutrient addition on the number and length of plants of S. muticum. Moreover, temporal variability of nutrient addition had an effect on biomass of S. muticum. In addition, intensity of nutrient enrichment and temporal variability to some extent affected native assemblages, with intensity of nutrients being mainly an important driver of the percentage cover of the most abundant functional groups. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract = {Twenty years of genetic studies of marine invaders have shown that successful invaders are often characterized by native and introduced populations displaying similar levels of genetic diversity. This pattern is presumably due to high propagule pressure and repeated introductions. The opposite pattern is reported in this study of the brown seaweed, Sargassum muticum, an emblematic species for circumglobal invasions. Albeit demonstrating polymorphism in the native range, microsatellites failed to detect any genetic variation over 1,269 individuals sampled from 46 locations over the Pacific–Atlantic introduction range. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from ddRAD sequencing revealed some genetic variation, but confirmed severe founder events in both the Pacific and Atlantic introduction ranges. Our study thus exemplifies the need for extreme caution in interpreting neutral genetic diversity as a proxy for invasive potential. Our results confirm a previously hypothesized transoceanic secondary introduction from NE Pacific to Europe. However, the SNP panel unexpectedly revealed two additional distinct genetic origins of introductions. Also, conversely to scenarios based on historical records, southern rather than northern NE Pacific populations could have seeded most of the European populations. Finally, the most recently introduced populations showed the lowest selfing rates, suggesting higher levels of recombination might be beneficial at the early stage of the introduction process (i.e., facilitating evolutionary novelties), whereas uniparental reproduction might be favored later in sustainably established populations (i.e., sustaining local adaptation).},

Based on cox3 gene and partial rbcLS operon sequences, intraspecific genetic variability was detected with three and two ribotypes, respectively. Temperature, not irradiance, was shown to significantly affect gamete release and fertilization. Elevated temperature and irradiance enhanced the growth of germlings and vegetative branchlets.

An overview is given of several aspect of an induced defense in many non-spiny Scenedesmus and some spiny Desmodesmus that may form typical protective eight-celled colonies to avoid mortality from numerous grazers. The morphological response does seem to be linked with a herbivorous zooplankton chemical cue, rather than to a more general animal excretory product. The grazing activity of small sized grazers is reduced, but not of large Daphnia. However, arguments are given why grazing protection of colonial Scenedesmus is probably more efficient under natural than under carbon/light limited laboratory conditions. Finally, a life-history cycle of Desmodesmus and Scenedesmus is presented in which biological aspects such as the anti-grazer response and sexual reproduction are being included.},

The rate of development is related to water temperature and is very rapid at 25°C. Detached branches were also cultured and they grew at the same rate in culture as in the sea: the rate of growth was inversely proportional to the degree of fertility, vegetative branches growing up to five times faster than fertile ones. The study of plants growing in the sea indicates a very rapid growth rate in the spring falling markedly as the plants become fertile in July and August.

We repeated the sampling in March, April and July to test for the consistency of patterns through time. There was no variability between rias (tens of kilometres apart), but substantial differences occurred at the other scales examined. Fertility and percent cover varied between locations (1.5-3 km apart), whereas morphological variables varied between sites (tens of metres apart) and quadrats (metres apart). Furthermore, patterns of variation were not consistent over time. The study demonstrated the importance of a multi-scale sampling programme for monitoring seaweed invasion.},

abstract = {Invasion biologists often suggest that phenotypic plasticity plays an important role in successful plant invasions. Assuming that plasticity enhances ecological niche breadth and therefore confers a fitness advantage, recent studies have posed two main hypotheses: (1) invasive species are more plastic than non-invasive or native ones; (2) populations in the introduced range of an invasive species have evolved greater plasticity than populations in the native range. These two hypotheses largely reflect the disparate interests of ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Because these sciences are typically interested in different temporal and spatial scales, we describe what is required to assess phenotypic plasticity at different levels. We explore the inevitable tradeoffs of experiments conducted at the genotype vs. species level, outline components of experimental design required to identify plasticity at different levels, and review some examples from the recent literature. Moreover, we suggest that a successful invader may benefit from plasticity as either (1) a Jack-of-all-trades, better able to maintain fitness in unfavourable environments; (2) a Master-of-some, better able to increase fitness in favourable environments; or (3) a Jack-and-master that combines some level of both abilities. This new framework can be applied when testing both ecological or evolutionary oriented hypotheses, and therefore promises to bridge the gap between the two perspectives. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The macroalgal assemblages at the low intertidal zone were studied at three localities on the north coast of Spain between 1977 and 2002. Two of these localities were invaded at the end of the 1980s by the brown seaweed Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt (Phaeophyta, Sargassaceae), whereas the third locality remained free of the invader. In 2002, distinct algal assemblages were noticed in invaded and noninvaded localities. No major changes were detected in the noninvaded locality. Apart from the obvious presence of S. muticum, the changes observed in the invaded localities included a significant reduction in abundance of the previous dominant species (the red alga Gelidium spinosum (S. G. Gmelin) P. C. Silva) as well as an increased number of species and diversity, increased primary productivity, and variations in the seasonal abundance patterns of some species. We speculate that the arrival of S. muticum had a negative effect on the dominant native G. spinosum, probably related to competition for light. This resulted in indirect positive effects on other species of the assemblage (such as Bifurcaria bifurcata R. Ross). Other small epiphytic opportunistic species might also have been benefited from the presence of S. muticum, because the invader has a rich associated epiphytic assemblage. {\textcopyright} 2005 Phycological Society of America.},

abstract = {Competition and fouling defence are important traits that may facilitate invasions by nonindigenous species. The ‘novel weapons hypothesis' (NWH) predicts that the invasive success of exotic species is closely linked to the possession of chemical defence compounds that the recipient community in the new range is not adapted to. In order to assess whether chemical defence traits contribute to invasion success, anti-bacterial, anti-quorum sensing, anti-diatom, anti-larval and anti-algal properties were investigated for the following algae: a) the invasive brown alga Sargassum muticum from both, its native (Japan) and invasive (Germany) range, b) the two non- or weak invasive species Sargassum fusiforme and Sargassum horneri from Japan, and c) Fucus vesiculosus, a native brown alga from Germany. Crude and surface extracts and lipid fractions of active extracts were tested against common fouling organisms and zygotes of a dominant competing brown alga. Extracts of the native brown alga F. vesiculosus inhibited more bacterial strains (75{\%}) than any of the Sargassum spp. (17 to 29{\%}). However, Sargassum spp. from Japan exhibited the strongest settlement inhibition against the diatom Cylindrotheca closterium, larvae of the bryozoan Bugula neritina and zygotes of the brown alga F. vesiculosus. Overall, extracts of S. muticum from the invasive range were less active compared to those of the native range suggesting an adaptation to lower fouling pressure and competition in the new range resulting in a shift of resource allocation from costly chemical defence to reproduction and growth. Non-invasive Sargassum spp. from Japan was equally defended against fouling and competitors like S. muticum from Japan indicating a necessity to include these species in European monitoring programs. The variable antifouling activity of surface and crude extracts highlights the importance to use both for an initial screening for antifouling activity.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the unprecedented rates of anthropogenic changes in ecosystems suggest that organisms have to migrate to new distributional ranges or to adapt commensurately quickly to new conditions to avoid becoming extinct. Pollution and global warming are two of the most important threats aquatic organisms will have to face in the near future. If genetic changes in a population in response to natural selection are extensively studied, the role of acclimation through phenotypic plasticity (the property of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to particular environmental conditions) in a species to deal with new environmental conditions remains largely unknown. Proteomics is the extensive study of the protein complement of a genome. It is dynamic and depends on the specific tissue, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. As the final product of gene expression, it is subjected to several regulatory steps from gene transcription to the functional protein. Consequently, there is a discrepancy between the abundance of mRNA and the abundance of the corresponding protein. Moreover, proteomics is closer to physiology and gives a more functional knowledge of the regulation of gene expression than does transcriptomics. The study of protein-expression profiles, however, gives a better portrayal of the cellular phenotype and is considered as a key link between the genotype and the organismal phenotype. Under new environmental conditions, we can observe a shift of the protein-expression pattern defining a new cellular phenotype that can possibly improve the fitness of the organism. It is now necessary to define a proteomic norm of reaction for organisms acclimating to environmental stressors. Its link to fitness will give new insights into how organisms can evolve in a changing environment. The proteomic literature bearing on chronic exposure to pollutants and on acclimation to heat stress in aquatic organisms, as well as potential application of proteomics in evolutionary issues, are outlined. While the transcriptome responses are commonly investigated, proteomics approaches now need to be intensified, with the new perspective of integrating the cellular phenotype with the organismal phenotype and with the mechanisms of the regulation of gene expression, such as epigenetics. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.

abstract = {Attached Sargassum muticum (Yendo) Fensholt was first observed in the westernmost part of Limfjorden (Denmark) in 1984, and it has since colonized Limfjorden from west to east at a rate of 15 to 17 km yr-1. By 1997, S, muticum had become the most dominant macroalga, covering more than 6{\%} of the bottom between 0 and 6 m depth, corresponding to ca 35{\%} cover of the hard substrate. In 1990, the cover of S. muticum was strongly correlated with distance from the original source area in the westernmost part of the estuary, suggesting that colonization was still in progress. By 1997, the cover of S. muticum was less correlated with distance from the original source area and more strongly correlated with the amount of hard substrate, indicating that colonization was reaching its climax. The absence of S. muticum from certain parts of Limfjorden by 1997 is therefore best explained by lack of hard substrate in these areas, and not by insufficient colonization time. The increased abundance of S. muticum between 1990 and 1997 affected species richness and diversity of the macroalgal community only marginally. However, multivariate community analysis revealed significant changes in the macroalgal community structure that were closely related to the increased abundance of S. muticum. Not only did the dominance of S. muticum increase significantly from 1990 to 1997, but the cover of several indigenous species belonging to the genera Laminaria, Fucus, and Codium decreased during the same period, indicating competitive displacement through competition for hard substrate and light.},

abstract = {Sargassum muticum has expanded rapidly along southern Scandinavian coasts since its introduction in the mid-1980s. Expansion into brackish areas has been limited, and the establishment of the species in such waters will largely depend on its ability to tolerate hyposaline conditions. Culture and field experiments have been used to examine the effects of reduced salinity on various life-history stages of S. muticum. In culture, fertilization was prevented at salinities of 15‰ and below, but not at 20-30‰. In a crossed two-factor culture experiment, germlings of various ages (1, 8, 15 days old) were cultured at various salinities (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30‰) for one week and re-exposed to 30‰ to test for ability to recover. Germling survival was significantly reduced after exposure to 5‰ during the first, but not the second or third, weeks after fertilization. One week's exposure to 0‰ was lethal to germlings. Growth of germlings was reduced by exposure to salinities below 25‰, and growth at 5‰ was less than 10{\%} of that at 25-30‰. Growth recovery of germlings after re-exposure to 30‰ was positively related to their age during exposure to sub-optimal salinities. To further explore the effects of salinity on growth and reproduction in S. muticum, plants were transplanted to three sites along a salinity gradient in a Norwegian fjord. At the low salinity site (9.5-17.4‰) growth and reproduction were slower than at the other sites where salinities were 14.7-27.1‰. These results demonstrate that salinity tolerance in S. muticum is lowest during fertilization, and increases with germling age. The salinity requirements of the least tolerant initial life stages will probably constitute a physiological barrier to the expansion of this species into brackish waters.},

abstract = {The high potential fitness benefit of phenotypic plasticity tempts us to expect phenotypic plasticity as a frequent adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. Examples of proven adaptive plasticity in plants, however, are scarce and most plastic responses actually may be 'passive' rather than adaptive. This suggests that frequently requirements for the evolution of adaptive plasticity are not met or that such evolution is impeded by constraints. Here we outline requirements and potential constraints for the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, identify open questions, and propose new research approaches. Important open questions concern the genetic background of plasticity, genetic variation in plasticity, selection for plasticity in natural habitats, and the nature and occurrence of costs and limits of plasticity. Especially promising tools to address these questions are selection gradient analysis, meta-analysis of studies on genotype-by-environment interactions, QTL analysis, cDNA-microarray scanning and quantitative PCR to quantify gene expression, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to quantify protein expression. Studying plasticity along the pathway from gene expression to the phenotype and its relationship with fitness will help us to better understand why adaptive plasticity is not more universal, and to more realistically predict the evolution of plastic responses to environmental change. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2005).},

abstract = {Introduced species provide an opportunity to examine responses to novel ecological conditions, in particular to the absence of co-evolved enemies. Introduced populations could evolve lower investment in resistance or could down-regulate their immune system as a plastic response to enemy absence. The response might have consequences for the success of introduced species. Assuming a trade-off between resistance and traits related to demographic success, an evolved change or reallocation from resistance could increase the chances of invasions. On the other hand, introduced populations could have increased resistance as a correlate of greater vigour and competitive ability among successful invaders [Sampling Bias hypothesis (SBH)]. These hypotheses make different predictions about investment in resistance in introduced populations. Using a New Zealand clonal snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), we examined the resistance of three introduced genotypes (one from the US and two from Europe) to several populations of a native range parasite (Microphallus sp.). One genotype (Euro A) was resistant to all native range parasite populations, consistent with the SBH. However, two remaining genotypes (Euro C and US 1) were less susceptible to parasite populations that were allopatric to their source populations. Furthermore, resistance of one genotype (US 1) collected from the introduced range was indistinguishable from its resistance when collected from the range of the parasite. Hence, there was no evidence for decreased resistance in the absence of native enemies, which is inconsistent with hypotheses that envision reduced allocation to resistance or a trade-off between competitive ability and resistance. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim  Recreational boating is arguably the largest unregulated vector for the introduction and spread of marine invasive species. Hull fouling communities have been recognized to harbour non-indigenous species (NIS), but presence should not be equated with transport. In this study, we characterize the presence of NIS in hull fouling communities, determine if host vessels transport these species and evaluate the importance of recreational boating as a vector for introduction and spread. Location  Coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada. Methods  Dive surveys in BC marinas were conducted to record the presence of NIS and to estimate their per cent cover. In addition, a boater questionnaire survey was used to determine common travel and maintenance practices. These results were combined to investigate the potential for recreational boats to transport NIS. Results  Nine NIS, including the highly invasive ascidians Styela clava and Botrylloides violaceus, and the macroalga Sargassum muticum, were found in hull fouling communities on recreational boats. Overall, per cent cover was generally low; however, niche areas were commonly fouled, even on active and otherwise clean boats. Fouling of niche areas was not related to either antifouling paint age or travel frequency, and fouling levels were highly variable among individual boats both within marinas and across regions. Main conclusions  Recreational boating is a major vector contributing to the spread of marine invasive species. Our results indicate that recreational boats represent a high-risk vector both for primary introduction and secondary spread of marine NIS and should be subject to vector management regulations.},
